# Interface Design for Testability

Good interfaces make testing natural:

1. **Accept dependencies, don't create them**

   ```python
   # Testable
   def process_order(order: Order, payment_gateway: PaymentGateway) -> None:
       pass

   # Hard to test
   def process_order(order: Order) -> None:
       gateway = StripeGateway()
       # ...
   ```

2. **Return results, don't produce side effects**

   ```python
   # Testable
   def calculate_discount(cart: Cart) -> float:
       pass

   # Hard to test
   def apply_discount(cart: Cart) -> None:
       cart.total -= discount
   ```

3. **Small surface area**
   - Fewer methods = fewer tests needed
   - Fewer params = simpler test setup
